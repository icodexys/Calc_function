# Calc_Function
functions calc_std() and calc_ct()   calculate operations in one sigle line
 
Is a function that will perform same task as eval() does but limited, 
calc_std() does the calculation in standard mode and calc_ct() in scientific mode which 
will give you a different results because it follows the arithmetic rules. 

This is for beginners to learn some path about calculation in one line. 
It will perfom a huge operation using - + * / and ^(Exponential notation) in one line, the input support  
Integers and floats....

operators supported:
+ --Addition
* --Multiplacation
- --subtraction
/ --Division
^ --Exponential notation(Still in Development)
